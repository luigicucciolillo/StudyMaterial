The "DevOps with Docker" course, offered by Helsinki in partnership with Eficode, provides a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to Docker and container orchestration, with a focus on Docker Compose. It's designed for individuals with basic software development and command-line knowledge, aiming to build confidence in containerization and configuration for real-world use.

**The course is divided into three parts**:

1. Learn Docker fundamentals, including images and containers, and how to build Docker images for existing projects. 
2. docker-compose: Master managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose and understand its role in orchestration. 
3. security and optimization: Learn to optimize Docker images for production, improve security, and explore advanced orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
