# 3.5 Summary

Once more, we began from scratch by learning how to convert a non-compose setup into a docker-compose.yml file and successfully executed it. In the process, we discovered several new and useful features provided by Docker Compose, such as the Docker network, which we hadn't realized we needed.

We have now mastered the setup of significantly more complex applications, involving up to five different services running simultaneously. These services only expose the necessary ports to the outside world or even just to our local machine.

Are we ready for production yet? Short answer: no. Long answer: depends on the situation. Good thing we have the [chapter 4](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker/chapter-4) still to go!
