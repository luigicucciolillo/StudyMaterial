# Use Knative When You Can, and Kubernetes When You Must 
David Hadas & Michael Maximilien, IBM

Knative extends Kubernetes. It lowers costs and improves the security of the deployed services. â€¦and yes! it also helps you become greener and save energy. This talk provides a fresh view of Knative. Forget about Serverless, consider Knative simply as an Opinionated Kubernetes. Knative advantages include Automation, Simplification, Auto-Scaling, Controlled-Revisions, and An Application Backbone. Deploying services via Knative is therefore a better choice than deploying the same services using Kubernetes directly. Knative requires each deployed service to work in a certain way. We show that many existing microservices are already built to run as Knative services offering an immediate benefit to users. Since Knative extends Kubernetes, it allows a mix and match between Knative services and Kubernetes microservices. We analyze the security benefits of deploying your services via Knative and show how Knative help protect users against configuration drift. We also show that even when users deploy vulnerable services, Knative protects such services from being exploited. Last, we show how using Knative reduces the energy footprint of your services and discuss what the future holds to continuing on this path of making Kubernetes energy efficient.
