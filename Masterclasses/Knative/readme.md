description: Knative extends Kubernetes. It lowers costs and improves the security of the deployed services. â€¦and yes! it also helps you become greener and save energy. This talk provides a fresh view of Knative. Forget about Serverless, consider Knative simply as an Opinionated Kubernetes. Knative advantages include Automation, Simplification, Auto-Scaling, Controlled-Revisions, and An Application Backbone. Deploying services via Knative is therefore a better choice than deploying the same services using Kubernetes directly. Knative requires each deployed service to work in a certain way. We show that many existing microservices are already built to run as Knative services offering an immediate benefit to users. Since Knative extends Kubernetes, it allows a mix and match between Knative services and Kubernetes microservices. We analyze the security benefits of deploying your services via Knative and show how Knative help protect users against configuration drift. We also show that even when users deploy vulnerable services, Knative protects such services from being exploited. Last, we show how using Knative reduces the energy footprint of your services and discuss what the future holds to continuing on this path of making Kubernetes energy efficient.

Description: Knative is a Kubernetes Extension that brings Functions as a Service to your Kubernetes Cluster. Knative provides components to build, serve, and auto-scale your apps.    Do you want to know how Knative Serving turns your Docker image into a function as a service? Do you want to know how Knative Serving scales your functions to meet demand? How Knative Serving scales to zero without ever dropping a single request? How does it work?    Using a systems modeling approach, this talk will explore Knative Serving, connect the dots between workload management and traffic management. You will leave with a concise and accurate understanding how Knative turns your source code into scalable, reliable applications.    Along the way, this talk highlights how Kubernetes Extensions enable brand new use cases, adding custom functionality and custom processes as first class citizens to your cluster.
