## Kubernetes Master Class: Monitoring and Alerting with Prometheus & Grafana

Rancher users and operators can collect custom metrics, automate alerts, notifications, and actions, and create cluster and project-level dashboards. In this class, you'll learn how to setup alerts with Rancher and Prometheus Alert Manager to find problems in your clusters before there's an outage. You'll also learn to visualize metrics for Kubernetes and for your applications so you can gather new insights to your users' usage patterns and your applications' run-time behaviors.

Join this Kubernetes Master Class to learn:

- Enabling monitoring in clusters and projects
- Monitoring important metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
- Viewing built-in dashboards and creating your own custom dashboards
- Setting up automated alerts and notifications based on custom metrics

## Kubernetes Master Class: Understanding and Implementing Service Mesh

Service mesh has developed a huge amount of excitement in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Istio is a service mesh tool built right into Rancher. Service mesh promises to add fault tolerance, canary rollouts, A/B testing, monitoring and metrics, tracing and observability, and authentication and authorization, eliminating the need for developers to instrument or write specific code to enable these capabilities. The goal is to let developers focus on their business logic and leave the rest to Kubernetes and Istio. But many users find it challenging to install, configure, monitor and manage their service mesh solution.

In this Kubernetes Master class, we'll discuss and demo:

- What service mesh is and why Istio is a good option
- Explain how Istio works
- How to enable Istio in Rancher
- Use cases and recommendations for how to use Istio with Rancher in your deployments

## Intro to K3s Online Training: Lightweight Kubernetes

Ready to get some training on using K3s, the lightweight Kubernetes distribution?

K3s is a lightweight implementation of Kubernetes that is easy to install and can run on x86 and ARM infrastructure with only 512 MB of RAM required to run it. 

K3s is geared towards teams that need to deploy applications quickly and reliably to resource-constrained environments. Some use cases for K3s are edge, Single Board Computers, IoT, and CI.

Watch the introductory training on K3s to learn how to:

- Install and upgrade K3s
- Deploy K3s on ARM
- Manage multiple K3s clusters and deploy applications
- Using K3d on the desktop
- Using K3os to deliver a container operating system
- Setup and configure a High Value install of K3s
